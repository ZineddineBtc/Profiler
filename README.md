# Profiler

This is an app that allows the user to create profiles and create records for every profile.<br/>
The app uses SQLite databases to store the profiles and their records (2 tables One-To-Many).<br/>

### Remarks
  - Notifications (mainly birthday notifications) require Build.VERSION_CODES.N
  - Personal Profile/Records are stored in seperate tables (total number of tables: 4)
